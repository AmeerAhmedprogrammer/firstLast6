The project is practice for the array.

This project requires that you know how memory works in the array specifically. I recommend you go into 2 programming college classes before doing this project to understand it.

If you need help, either message me at aahmed58@nyit.edu. Please don't spam me. I will do my best to get back to your message as soon as I can.

I (Ameer) is the only one who maintains this project.
